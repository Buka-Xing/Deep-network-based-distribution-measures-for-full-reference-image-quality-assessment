# Deep network based distribution measures for full-reference image quality assessment
----------------------------
This is the repository of paper [Image Quality Assessment: Gauging Perceptual Degradation by Distribution Measures in the Deep Feature Space](xxx). 

Three deep network based distribution measures are proposed, **the DeepWSD**, **the DeepJSD** and **the DeepSKLD**.

## Advantages of deep network based distribution measures

## Updating log:
2022/10/20: the repository is created and the quality assessment result, the maximum difference competition results, image super-resolution and denoising results 
are uploaded in 'results' folder.

## Acknowledgement:
We thanks a lot for work of 'dingkeyan93' and work of DISTS. DeepWSD is mostly inspired by the insightful idea from him.  

We also thank a lot for the [RCAN](https://github.com/yjn870/RCAN-pytorch) repository proposed by 'yjn870', which is the super-resolution backbone network we used.
Meanwhile, the [FFDNet](https://github.com/Aoi-hosizora/FFDNet_pytorch) used for denoising is proposed by 'Aoi-hosizora', we also appreciate he/her work.
