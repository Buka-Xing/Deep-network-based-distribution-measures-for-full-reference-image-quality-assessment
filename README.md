# Deep network based distribution measures for full-reference image quality assessment
----------------------------
This is the repository of paper [Image Quality Assessment: Gauging Perceptual Degradation by Distribution Measures in the Deep Feature Space](xxx). 

Three deep network based distribution measures are proposed, **the DeepWSD**, **the DeepJSD** and **the DeepSKLD**.

## Advantages of deep network based distribution measures

## Updating log:
2022/10/20: the repository is created and the quality assessment result, the maximum difference competition results, image super-resolution and denoising results 
are uploaded in 'results' folder.
